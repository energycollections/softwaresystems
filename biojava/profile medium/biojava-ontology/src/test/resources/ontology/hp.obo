A meatus in a phenotypic male may be positioned either on the glans (glandular or balanic epispadias), the shaft (penile epispadias) or at the attachment of the penis to the abdominal wall (penopubic epispadias). Alternatively, the urethra may be an open groove along the dorsal shaft of the penis, with no readily recognized meatus. Epispadias is a frequent component of Bladder exstrophy, but should be coded separately.

Bowing usually becomes more obvious in an erect penis, but is frequently also palpable when stretching a flaccid penis. Chordee can be congenital or acquired; if the former, it can be associated with Webbed Penis or Hypospadias, which should be coded separately.
